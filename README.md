# Todo app
A basic todo app using .NET Core Web API (C#) and Angular.

## Setup
The server app will run on port 5000 and the client on 4200. CORS (dev only) is set up specifically for this arrangement. 

You will need to go into the Server folder and start the solution with:
    `dotnet run --project TodoApp/TodoApp.csproj` 
Then go into the client folder and run:
    `ng serve`
